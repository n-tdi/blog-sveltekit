# Rubik's Cubes

Rubiks cubes are really crazy, they can have over __460 trillion__ different configurations!! I've just gotten into learning to solve rubiks cubes and I'm having *alot* of fun

### Speed cubes

Speed cubes are basically rubiks cubes but they have magnets for corenrs so they turn a lot lot faster. I bought like a 7$ speed cube recently and I __LOVE__ it!!

It turns really smooth and the experience with it makes me feel like im a cubing god! Which im not really, my fatest time is just under 2 minutes. Which to a non cuber sounds very fast but in the cubing world, people get sub 10-30s on AVERAGEEEEEE. 

Hopefully one day I beable to get that skill :P
