# Finals week is coming up

Im so nervous, I've studied a lot and _tirelessly_ gone over all the flash cards I could make!

I really hope the week goes well. I was able to get out of my french final because I wasn't taking french class in the first few months of school so thats a plus. Math will be hard but exciting bc i love math no cap.

_Edit: I did really good on all my finals! Very happy with their outcomes :D_
