# Friends in the real world

Friends are great to have, believe me, but it can be very hard for some of us to make friends in the real world. In the real world everyone judges you for your appearance and other unfair things. In the beginning of my social years I found it very hard to make friends IRL, so if you feel this way, you aren't alone.

# Friends in the online world

Meeting people online is a very scary thing, you have to be 100% sure that who you're talking to isn't trying to use you for their own gain. It took me about a full year before I was able to _safely_ say that my now BFF online wasn't actually some malicious user. People online don't know you so you can say whatever you want (to an extent.) People online cant judge you off your apperance aswell unless they know who you are IRL. Two strangers are able to bond really well with common interests and thats why many people find it easy to make friends online. Just be __CAREFUL__!

## Conclusions

Make friends whereever you want to! Just don't let others get on your nerves or take advtange of you.
